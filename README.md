This repo contains various tropical-related Python plotting tools. 

The radar notebook was built using a combination of example code from Py-ART (radar data), 
MetPy (accessing buoy data via siphon), 
and Kevin Goebbert (plotting current surface observations). The second notebook features various plots for individual storms
as well as a "Tropics Dashboard." This was built largely from examples provided by the tropycal package.
